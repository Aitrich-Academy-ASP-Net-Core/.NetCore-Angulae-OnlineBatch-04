    <h3>US interest rate cut: UAE residents, businesses with loans get instant relief</h3>
    
    <p>
        Dubai: UAE residents with monthly paybacks on their loans, mortgages and credit card bills will feel an immediate relief from the 0.50 per cent interest rate cut announced overnight by the US Fed and matched by the UAE Central Bank instantly.

        The best part of those with EMIs is that the rate cut actually went up to 0.5% rather than the expected 0.25%. Whatever be the case, these will come in quite handy in easing some of the additional costs UAE residents with loans or other exposures had been paying since March of 2022, which is when the US started on its rate hikes. (The Fed hiked rates 11 times since then.)

            If there’s one lesson every investor had taken to heart up until 2007, it was this: buy as many assets with borrowed money as possible because asset prices always rise.
