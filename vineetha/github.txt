GitHub is a code hosting platform for collaboration and version control.

GitHub essentials are:

*Repositories

*Branches

*Commits

*Pull Requests

*Git (the version control software GitHub is built on)

Repository

A GitHub repository can be used to store a development project.

It can contain folders and any type of files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Documents, Data, Images).

A GitHub repository should also include a licence file and a README file about the project.

A GitHub repository can also be used to store ideas, or any resources that you want to share.
