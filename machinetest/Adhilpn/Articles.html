            Emirates will be introducing its refurbished Boeing 777s on six routes in the US, including the debut of its latest Business Class seats and Premium Economy.

            The retrofitted Boeing 777 aircraft are scheduled to operate on direct flights to Chicago, Boston, Dallas Fort Worth, and Seattle. In addition, flights to Miami linked to Bogotá and to Newark via Athens will also have the refreshed aircraft featuring Emirates’ four cabin classes.

        Move expected to be only the first in a series of rate cuts that will extend into 2025

            The Federal Reserve slashes interest rates by an aggressive 50 basis points from the current 23-year high of between 5.25 per cent and 5.50 per cent, in what is the first interest rate cut since Covid-19 that marks a major shift for the US economy.

            Shortly after the Fed's announcement, the UAE Central Bank decided to cut the base rate applicable to the Overnight Deposit Facility (ODF) by 50 basis points – from 5.40 per cent to 4.90 per cent, effective from Thursday, September 19, 2024.
            Dubai: UAE residents with monthly paybacks on their loans, mortgages and credit card bills will feel an immediate relief from the 0.50 per cent interest rate cut announced overnight by the US Fed and matched by the UAE Central Bank instantly.

            The best part of those with EMIs is that the rate cut actually went up to 0.5% rather than the expected 0.25%. Whatever be the case, these will come in quite handy in easing some of the additional costs UAE residents with loans or other exposures had been paying since March of 2022, which is when the US started on its rate hikes. (The Fed hiked rates 11 times since then.)

            The Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) imposed a financial sanction on a bank operating in the UAE. The decision is pursuant to its law on anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism and illegal organisations.

            The CBUAE has fined the bank Dh5 million, and directed the bank to present the Central Bank's action to the board of directors of the overseas headquarters.

            Dubai: Privately owned companies in the UAE need to have at least one woman as a member of their board of directors, according to the Ministry of Economy. This must be done after the completion of the current term of any company's board.
            <blockquote>
                "This decision is a vital component of the nation's broader strategy to enhance diversity in the corporate sector and increase women's representation in leadership roles," said a statement from the Ministry. "Aligned with the UAE’s efforts to raise its global competitiveness rankings, the initiative demonstrates the leadership's unwavering commitment to empowering women, ensuring they play a vital role in the country’s sustainable development."
