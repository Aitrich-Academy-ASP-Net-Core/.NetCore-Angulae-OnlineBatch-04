What is Git?

Git is a free, open-source version control system that helps you track changes made to code, documents, or other digital content.

Key Concepts:

1. Repository (Repo): The central location where all files, history, and metadata are stored.
2. Commit: A snapshot of changes made to the repository.
3. Branch: Independent lines of development, allowing multiple features or fixes to be worked on simultaneously.
4. Merge: Combining changes from two or more branches.
5. Remote: A repository hosted on a server, often used for collaboration.

Basic Git Commands:

1. git init: Initialize a new Git repository.
2. git add: Stage changes for the next commit.
3. git commit: Create a new commit.
4. git log: View commit history.
5. git branch: Create, list, or delete branches.
6. git checkout: Switch between branches.
7. git merge: Merge changes from another branch.
8. git remote: Manage remote repositories.
9. git push: Push changes to a remote repository.
10. git pull: Fetch changes from a remote repository.

Git Workflow:

1. Create a new repository (git init).
2. Make changes to files.
3. Stage changes (git add).
4. Commit changes (git commit).
5. Create a new branch (git branch).
6. Switch to the new branch (git checkout).
7. Make changes, stage, and commit.
8. Merge changes (git merge).
9. Push changes to a remote repository (git push).
